            <p>To be eligible for prizes, you must have been in middle 
                school or below in the 2020–2021 school year. If you are older,

                Thanks to our generous sponsors, we will be able to hand out $2026 worth of prizes to each of:
              <li> Gold: Top-10 finishers overall (based on scores from all three rounds)<br><br>
              <li> Silver: Top-10 finishers in accuracy who did not rank in Gold<br><br>
              <li> Bronze: Top-10 finishers in sprint who did not rank Gold or Silver<br><br>
              This means that regardless or whether you qualify for invitationals, you have a chance! Note taht through this system, 
              every participant is limited to winning one prize. <br><br>
              Prizes will not be publicized due to email complaints on prize selection, but to give you a taste for what you can win, 
                  first place gold wins $150 and second place gold wins $100, in the form of any gift card you want. </p>
